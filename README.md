# Fuzzy Control Simulation

This repository contains MATLAB code for simulating fuzzy controllers. The simulations demonstrate the implementation and behavior of fuzzy control systems, particularly for second-order systems.

## Contents

- **[FuzzyControl_Simul_2nd_order.m](FuzzyControl_Simul_2nd_order.m)**: Main MATLAB script for simulating a fuzzy control system for a second-order process.
- **[Gauss_mbs.m](Gauss_mbs.m)**: MATLAB function implementing Gaussian membership functions.
- **[Gauss_mbs_sinput.m](Gauss_mbs_sinput.m)**: MATLAB function implementing Gaussian membership functions with specific input.
- **[fuzzyrule.m](fuzzyrule.m)**: MATLAB script defining fuzzy control rules.
- **[fuzzyrule_specific.m](fuzzyrule_specific.m)**: MATLAB script defining specific fuzzy control rules.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (for running the `.m` files)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mincasurong/Fuzzy-Control.git
    cd Fuzzy-Control
    ```

2. Open the desired `.m` file in MATLAB and run it to execute the fuzzy control simulation.

### Example

To run the main fuzzy control simulation for a second-order system:
1. Open `FuzzyControl_Simul_2nd_order.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to visualize the behavior of the fuzzy control system.

## Fuzzy Control System

Fuzzy control systems use fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and imprecision in control processes. They are particularly useful for complex systems where traditional control methods may not be effective.

### Key Features

- **Fuzzy Logic**: Utilizes fuzzy logic rules for control.
- **Membership Functions**: Implements Gaussian membership functions.
- **Second-Order System Simulation**: Focuses on simulating fuzzy control for second-order systems.
